	* TODO, configure.in, kibot.spec, doc/module-tutorial.html,
	kibot/m_irclib.py, modules/test.py:
	
	Allow raising StopHandlingEvent to... uh... stop handling an event
	:)
	
	Preparing for 0.0.12 release.

2003-09-25 20:24  mstenner

	* ReleaseNotes, TODO, configure.in, kibot/ircDB.py,
	modules/auth.py, modules/irc.py, modules/messaging.py:
	
	Replaced profile_change with more fine-grained events (int_*);
	Added more docs to auth module; Added the 'irc.raw' command; Fixed
	a bug in the 'irc.mode' command; Added 'autoop' perm (see release
	notes); Added xml.sax text to configure script.

	updated changelog for 0.0.11 release

2003-09-07 14:40  mstenner

	* TODO, configure.in, kibot.spec, doc/Makefile.in, kibot/ircDB.py,
	modules/Makefile.in, modules/auth.py, modules/irc.py,
	modules/messaging.py:
	
	preparing for 0.0.11 release

2003-09-06 16:05  mstenner

	* kibot/ircDB.py:
	
	Fixed the kibot-control problem with commands that do "internal"
	permissions checks, like auth.profile.	I did this by adding
	'owner' to GodUser's permissions.  It is not completely foolproof,
	but should handle all the standard commands, which are the ones
	that are really important from kibot-control.  It is intended to be
	an administrative interface, after all.

2003-09-06 15:35  mstenner

	* TODO, kibot/ircDB.py, modules/auth.py:
	
	Fixed authpass.  It consisted of a few problems: 1) profile_change
	was not being sent, 2) ircdb.rescan was setting all users that
	didn't match masks to None, and 3) there was a bug in _fetch_all's
	nickmask section which basically prevented it from working for
	authpass'ed users.  Yeesh.

2003-08-16 12:23  mstenner

	* ChangeLog:
	
	release 0.0.10

2003-08-16 12:11  mstenner

	modules/log.py:
	
	fixed god-mode bug in permDB.py; added log.py; preparing for 0.0.10
	release

2003-08-16 11:23  mstenner

	* kibot/: Settings.py, m_irclib.py:
	
	modified Settings so that set_func, get_func, and update_func pass
	the kibot module instance as the first arg.  This makes it easy use
	a class method which then gets treated like an instance method.
	
	changed the internally-generated event 'send_action' to
	'send_ctcp_action' to be more consistent with server-generated
	events.

2003-08-09 21:21  mstenner

	* modules/rand.py:
	
	made rand.quotestats take an optional nick

2003-07-23 21:29  mstenner

	* TODO, doc/kibot.1, kibot/Options.prepy, modules/base.py:
	
	Changed ircname to default to nick.

2003-05-20 21:45  mstenner

	* modules/debug.py:
	
	fixed debug module to deal with new settings

2003-05-20 20:40  mstenner

	* modules/bugzilla.py:
	
	New bugzilla module.  Servers can now be added and deleted via irc.

2003-05-20 20:35  mstenner

	* modules/units.py:
	
	New version of units.  Removal of "stones".

2003-05-20 20:08  mstenner

	* modules/auth.py:
	
	Changed the perm-handling of auth.profile.  It's a more sensible
	syntax now.

2003-05-20 19:40  mstenner

	* kibot/Settings.py, kibot/m_irclib.py, modules/base.py,
	modules/irc.py, modules/test.py:
	
	Added get_conv_func to Settings.
	
	Added message wrapping to m_irclib.py to fix "the tim problem". 
	This is actually a non-trivial problem that is addressed here in an
	imperfect way.	The problem is that no message can be more than 512
	characters long.  That's the WHOLE raw message between any client
	and server.  If you pass a privmsg or notice (or anything else)
	that's too long, it gets chopped.  This is particularly nasty if a
	message from the bot to the server is short enough, but it WILL be
	to long when sent from the server to the other clients.  For now,
	all privmsgs and notices are limited to 412 (512 - 100) characters.
	 Hopefully, this will be anough space.
	
	Changed "die" and "restart" cperms from "owner" to "manager".
	
	Added "oper" and "mode" commands to irc.py.

2003-05-09 20:05  mstenner

	* TODO, kibot/m_irclib.py, modules/test.py:
	
	I'm beginning the conversion to a more fully event-driven
	framework.  Previously, only incoming events (small "e") were
	handled as Event()s (privmsg, join, etc).  There were also some
	fully-internal events as well, such as command_not_found and
	permission_denied.  However, outgoing events were still done in a
	very direct fashion.  That is, when you call self.bot.conn.privmsg,
	that function pretty much directly wrote to the socket (well, ok,
	it called send_raw, which really did write to the socket).  This
	made it very hard for another module to know what outgoing events
	occured.
	
	This was most problematic for stuff like channel logging.  Since
	the server does not send a client it's own messages back, you need
	to keep track of both what you send and what you are sent.  Now, I
	have taken some first steps toward dealing with this by making
	outgoing events Events also.
	
	Methods like ServerConnection.privmsg still exist, but they are
	basically convenience functions for raising Events.  privmsg raises
	the 'send_privmsg' event, etc.	The connection object automatically
	sets handlers for those events, so it should be pretty transparent
	to the module programmer.  As evidence of that, nothing broke (or
	so it seems) when I made the change.
	
	I'm not completely convinced that this is exactly the way I want to
	do this, so things may change in the future.  You've been warned :)

2003-05-04 10:01  mstenner

	* TODO, doc/kibot.1, modules/rand.py:
	
	Updated manpage to say that nick and channels are remembered.
	
	Fixed minor bug in rand.rtopic.

2003-05-03 23:20  mstenner

	* kibot/ircDB.py:
	
	Fixed a couple of last-minute bugs relating to remembered channels.

2003-05-03 22:43  mstenner

	* kibot/Stasher.py:
	
	Minor bugfix in Stasher.

2003-05-03 22:01  mstenner

	* ReleaseNotes, doc/module-tutorial.html, kibot/Settings.py:
	
	Various documentation updates.

2003-05-03 19:20  mstenner

	* kibot/ModuleManager.py, kibot/ircDB.py, modules/rand.py,
	modules/test.py:
	
	Added commented out broken feature to ModuleManager :)	I'd like to
	make orphaned handlers and timers get stripped on module unload,
	but I don't know of a good way to do it yet.
	
	Fixed a bug in the _on_topic handler of icdDB.
	
	Added rtopic to the rand module.  It puts a random quote in the
	topic periodically.

2003-05-02 22:14  mstenner

	* TODO, modules/auth.py, modules/base.py, modules/irc.py,
	modules/magic.py, tools/make_module_docs.py:
	
	Made make_module_docs deal with command groups.  It doesn't group
	the output, but it reads the structure and preserves the order of
	commands.
	
	Put _command_groups in auth, base, irc, and magic.  Made
	miscellaneous doc changes in some of those, too.  Nothing major.

2003-05-01 21:26  mstenner

	* modules/: base.py, test.py:
	
	Implemented command groups.  The test module uses them.  They
	should be put in the other modules soon.

2003-04-30 19:06  mstenner

	* TODO, tools/make_module_docs.py:
	
	fixed make_module_docs to deal with new settings

2003-04-29 21:28  mstenner

	* TODO, kibot.spec, kibot/BaseModule.py, kibot/Flood.py,
	kibot/ModuleManager.py, kibot/Settings.py, kibot/ircDB.py,
	kibot/permDB.py, modules/acro.py, modules/base.py,
	modules/debug.py, modules/google.py, modules/rand.py,
	modules/slashdot.py, modules/test.py, modules/whereis.py:
	
	Too long between commits.  Sorry :)
	
	Fixed (I hope) rpm build bug that only showed up on RHL < 9.
	
	Made _stash and _unstash (in BaseModule) not include attributes
	which are not set (rather than setting them to None).  Both now
	take an option "default" argument, which will recreate the old
	behavior if set to None.  Many modules (including core modules)
	were modified to accommodate this change, either by passing in
	default=None, or by setting defaults before calling
	self._unstash().
	
	Documented Flood.py a little.  Getting ready to try and speed it up
	a bit.	This is of course a bit touchy as differnt servers can have
	different flood algorithms.
	
	Made ircDB track channel topics.
	
	New settings.  This means the inclusion of kibot.Settings, and many
	changes in base.py.  I still need to fix make_module_docs.py.
	
	Several additions to module/test.py

2003-04-26 17:05  mstenner

	* TODO, modules/irc.py:
	
	Improved the syntax of irc.kick.

2003-04-26 11:08  mstenner

	* modules/rand.py:
	
	Two major changes to rand.  First, made "quote" work like
	"addquote" when more than just a nick is provided.  Second, made
	quote addition smart about "quote <joe> thing he said" and "quote *
	joe does a thing".  This (or the first part, anyway) was Peter
	Teichman's idea [
	http://devel.linux.duke.edu/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=25 ]

2003-04-25 20:11  mstenner

	* TODO, doc/kibot.1, kibot/CommandHandler.py,
	kibot/OptionParser.py, kibot/Options.prepy, kibot/ircDB.py,
	kibot/m_irclib.py, modules/rand.py, tools/kibot.init:
	
	Added init script example to the manpage.  Also added a tiny bit of
	documentation (in the form of a comment) to the init script itself.
	
	Fixed a bug with direct connections.  The recent changes allowing
	fully private communication had caused a little trouble.  Because
	the DC is handled differently, the user lookups broke when they
	became based on nickmask rather than nick.  I fixed that.
	
	Made Options.py and OptionParser.py deal a little better with
	broken config files.  It now complains (dies, actually) if it finds
	unexpected config options.  This is configurable.  For example, any
	option in a section that starts with "mod_" is allowed, because
	those are reserved for use by modules, and there's no way for the
	bot to know what will or will not be put there.
	
	Removed handlers from rand because magic does that soooooo much
	better anyway.

2003-04-23 20:36  mstenner

	* TODO, kibot/ircDB.py, modules/whereis.py, tools/kibot.init:
	
	Forgot to mention in previous commit: added response to /invite. 
	/invite is treated like join.  Basically, this keeps you from
	having to both /invite the bot and tell it to join and invite-only
	channel.
	
	Minor documentation and formatting changes to kibot.init,
	whereis.py.
	
	Fixed ircdata file location bug in ircDB.py

2003-04-22 22:29  mstenner

	* TODO, doc/kibot-control.1, kibot/Bot.py, kibot/CommandHandler.py,
	kibot/ircDB.py, kibot/m_irclib.py, kibot/permDB.py,
	modules/auth.py, modules/irc.py:
	
	Made permissions checks work for users that are not on a common
	channel with the bot.  This amounts to using
	get_user(nickmask=nickmask) rather than get_user(nick=nick).  The
	latter is less useful because nick->user maps are only maintained
	for users that are on a common channel with the bot.  If a user is
	not on a common channel with the bot, nick-tracking is not
	possible.
	
	Also made the bot remember nick and channels (and ignore remembered
	values with --forget).	To that end, added ircDB.set_nick(), which
	allows nick-setting with less annoyance.

2003-04-17 20:38  mstenner

	* ChangeLog:
	
	updated changelog

2003-04-17 20:36  mstenner

	added signals warning to man pages
	
	release version 0.0.8

2003-04-17 20:23  mstenner

	* ReleaseNotes, TODO, configure.in, kibot.spec, doc/Makefile.in,
	kibot/ircDB.py, tools/kibot.init:
	
	added warning to ReleaseNotes about magic data; fixed url bug in
	kibot.spec; added sample conf files to spec and Makefile.in; typo
	fix in kibot.init
	
	Added code to ircDB to deal with mbot->kibot change.  The problem
	is that when the ircdb data was stored under 0.0.7, the class was
	"mbot.ircDB.KnownUser" but now it needs to be
	"kibot.ircDB.KnownUser".  The trick to get around this is to push
	kibot.ircDB into sys.modules with key "mbot.ircDB".  Then when
	pickle looks for "mbot.ircDB", it _thinks_ it finds it, but it
	really gets kibot.ircDB.  This code should be removed a few
	versions down the road.

	* INSTALL, Makefile.in, bin/Makefile.in, doc/Makefile.in,
	kibot/Makefile.in, modules/Makefile.in, pymod/Makefile.in,

	* INSTALL, README, kibot.spec, doc/defaults.conf, doc/simple.conf,
	kibot/Options.prepy:

	* Makefile.in, TODO, configure.in, py-compile, bin/Makefile.in,
	doc/Makefile.in, kibot/Makefile.in, modules/Makefile.in,
	pymod/Makefile.in, tools/Makefile.in:
	
	fixed several build bugs
	
	added the --with-python-dirs to the configure script.  With this,
	kibot python modules are put in the standard location associated
	with the chosen python binary (according to --with-python). 
	Without it (the default), they are installed to "best guess" under
	--libdir, which is usually, $prefix/lib.  So "configure
	--with-python=/usr/bin/python2.2 --prefix=/home/foo" usually leads
	to modules in /home/foo/lib/python2.2/site-packages/

2003-04-15 15:29  mstenner

	* ChangeLog, TODO, configure.in, kibot.spec:
	
	preparing for 0.0.8 release - testing for problems in the build
	process
	
	OK, so this ChangeLog file is kindof a lie :)  In order to do the
	mbot->kibot change, I actually edited the cvs repository so we
	could keep clean histories on files (the standard "cvs add/remove"
	gripe).  However, since the changelog is auto-generated from cvs
	(via cvs2cl.pl, which I highly recommend), this little white lie to
	cvs becomes a lie to all the world.  Sorry, world.

	pymod/magicdata.py, tools/Makefile.in, tools/ircdb-convert.py,
	tools/ircdb-dump.py, tools/kibot.init, tools/make_module_docs.py:
	
	Yeah, OK... so everything changed.  Basically, mbot->kibot,
	mbot/MBot.py->kibot/Bot.py,
	mbot/MBotModule.py->kibot/BaseModule.py.
	
	Mixed in with that, we also have a few magic.py updates.  Here are
	the ChangeLog entries for those (all of these by timothy):
	
	pymod/magicdata.py: Changed the %n flag to %N in magicdata's
	bad_question responses.
	
	Fixed the unlearn command, which had a broken for loop.  This stems
	from a bad interface with the underlying AccessTree class:
	AccessTrees implement a __contains__ method but not an __iter__
	method.  So, one can say "if thing in self.MD.status.channels" but
	NOT "for channel in self.MD.status.channels".  This is confusing.
	
	Fixed indentation error in magic.__init__ and fixed q command
	(previously referred to _get_response, should be
	_get_question_response.)
	
	At this point, magic seems to work OK and appears to be ready for
	live testing.  By running the bot with logging level >= 6, we can
	see that it requires some optimization (_get_* helpers are called
	several times consecutively, for example).  This is being addressed
	in the unstable branch.
	
	Hopefully stable, "temporary" magic module.  kibot's data has yet
	to be moved over (later this evening).
	
	self.log is now a wrapper around self.bot.log.
	
	Low-level helpers and handlers log with two levels.  Level 4 is for
	"bad" things from which the bot can likely recover.  Level 6 is for
	identifying the low-level handlers as they are called.	The logging
	behavior will change soon, when the unstable branch is merged in.
