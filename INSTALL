This file discusses the installation of kibot.  For help getting kibot
to run, see the README file.  For help using kibot once it's running,
see the manpages, documents in doc, and the "online" help.

INSTALLING FROM SOURCE

  To install kibot directly from source, run the following commands:

  ./configure
  make
  make install

  If your default version of python is not recent enough (pre 2.2)
  then you will need to specify your python binary on the configure
  command line, like so:

  ./configure --with-python=/usr/local/bin/python2.2

  You may also find the --prefix option helpful if you want to install
  in a non-standard location, such as a home directory or /usr/local.
  By default, it will install under /usr.

  By default, configure will put the main kibot python modules in its
  "best-guess" position within your prefix.  If you want to force them
  to be placed inside the standard library location, use the configure
  option --with-python-dirs.  Note, if you do not use
  --with-python-dirs, you will likely need to add the install
  directory to your python search path via the PYTHONPATH environment
  variable.

BUILDING PACKAGES

  It is generally recommened (for reasons completely unrelated to
  kibot) that you install from some sort of package, such as an rpm or
  deb.  You should be able to build an rpm directly from a downloaded
  tarball by running:

  rpm -ta kibot-VERSION.tar.gz

    or

  rpmbuild -ta kibot-VERSION.tar.gz

  depending on your version of rpm.

  [ you may find it handy to put something like
    %_topdir /home/YOURHOMEDIR/rpm
    in your ~/.rpmmacros file ]
