0.0.12
  * Separation of the 'op' perm into 'op' and 'autoop'.  'op' now ONLY
    allows you to execute the 'op' command.  As you might have guessed,
    'autoop' will cause you to be automatically op-ed when you join
    a channel, etc.

    Bot owners with a pre-0.0.12 install will see everyone suddenly
    stop being op-ed.  All bot owners should do:
      addgrant manager autoop
    so that 'autoop' can be granted (by managers).  If you want to
    continue the old behavior, you should also do
      addimply op autoop
    so that everyone with 'op' automatically has 'autoop'.

  * The 'profile_change' event has been removed and replaced with
    several more fine-grained events.  This should not affect normal
    users, but it could conceivably affect custom modules that use the
    'profile_change' event.

0.0.9
  * Minor changes to the way stashers and settings work.  Now, by default
    when a stasher loads, it will not create attribues that were not in
    the stasher.  Previously, it would fill in these values with None.  The
    new way is actually much more convenient, but minor changes may need
    to be made.  self._unstash and self._stash now take an option argument
    that is the default to be used if an item isn't defined.  Using None
    for this argument recreates the old behavior.

0.0.8
  * The structure of magic data (magic.pickle) has changed, and so data
    created under version 0.0.7 can probably not be used in 0.0.8.
    Sorry.

0.0.3
  * Handling of the ircdb file has changed.  If you want to keep your
    list of Known Users, you'll need to convert to the new format with
    the following commands:

      cd data;   # your bot's data directory
      python2 /usr/share/doc/mbot-0.0.3/ircdb-convert.py ircdb ircdb.pickle

    If you've used different paths or filenames, you'll need to adjust
    accordingly.
