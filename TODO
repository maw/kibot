BUGS
    possible problems with signals and system calls
    recognize doesn't op correctly if done privately (check the logs next time)
    v_thunder reports: autoload doesn't work
    UNICODE issues - google search on "profi"
	double-op when the bot gets ops on a channel and someone there has
       autoop but isn't yet op-ed
    kibot: fakemodule.thing        module-finding is broken
	more invite issues
    google module breaks with  PyXML 0.8.1 (under python 2.2.2)
    log doesn't check for existence of logdir
    log doesn't strip control (color) characters
    logdir isn't stashed

TODO:


  REWRITE MAGIC
    permission_denied and command_not_found handlers should
      do nothing and NOT return "NO MORE" for private messages
    observe "ignore" on pubmsg/action
    write magic.__doc__
    make magic recognize actions (via ctcp)
    make magic respond to ".*, %B\?$" as a question (note: the comma is
        important to distinguish between talking TO the bot and ABOUT the
        bot - "shall we kill mybot?" vs. "shall we kill, mybot?")
    make magic.say take an optional "target" channel as first arg.  This
        would probably work like invite or op.  (discuss first)
    MAGIC: have .say (public) .tell (privmsg), .action (pubaction)
    MAGIC: implement .export and .import (of magic data), preferably
        in a human-readable and -editable format
    make magic record unanswerable questions for later modification :)
    for magic, something like %n, but that EXCLUDES %N and %b
    think about filtering OTHER outgoing text... basically output filters

  FOR 0.1.0
    Tidy the syntax of: slashdot.notify, ...
        
  HIGH PRIORITY
    write docs
    clean code
    improve module-reloading to have dependancies, etc.
    make inter-module access easier
    remove ircdb_file option
    links to code documentation
    make kibot respect ctcp version

  MEDIUM PRIORITY
    possibly add perms to some of these potentially annoying things, 
        perhaps creating a new perm specifically for magic
    add a clean/check nick function (to be used by set_nick, probably)
    make profile and other commands smart - fall back to nick
    change profile cperm to allow "profile self"
      (these last two may be incompatible for security reasons, unless
       profile handles perms internally or with a function cperm)
    better use of "unknown" perms
    DCC :)
    write irclib2 (both to clean up the irclib/m_irclib split and also
        to give a little back :) )

  LOW PRIORITY
    cleanup is not very tidy - socket removal, etc
    build process is a bit ugly (and repetitious) - tidy it up
    make stasher backup comparison more efficient
    strip out timers/handlers on module_unload (turns out this is hard)
    ACRO: add better db back in (changed format, harder to use?)

MODULE IDEAS
    friends (me)
    service - or unix, or something that provides "service"
