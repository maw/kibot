    <h1>Tutorial: Writing a Kibot Module</h1>

	<p>
	  One of the primary design goals of kibot is make modules easy to
	  write.  The bot itself is really just a framework upon which to
	  hang modules.  This document is a tutorial showing how to use
	  the basic tools that are available.  It is not an exhaustive
	  reference of all of the available tools.  There are (or will be)
	  other documents for that, and this tutorial refers to them when
	  possible.

	<h2>Your first legal module</h2>

    <p>
      A kibot module is a python class instance.  When asked to load a
      module of name <code>FOO</code>, the bot will look (in the bot
      module load path) for a python module named <code>FOO.py</code>
      (or <code>FOO.pyc</code> or <code>FOO.pyo</code>).  If it finds
      one, it will load that python module, and look for a class named
      <code>FOO</code> within it.  An instance of that class will be
      created, with one argument passed in, the bot object itself.
      The simplest module conceivable, then, is this:
    </p>

<pre class=python>
# in a file called FOO.py
class FOO:
    def __init__(self, bot):
        self.bot = bot
</pre>

    <p>
      You might want to derive your module from the class <a
      href="kibot/kibot.BaseModule.html#BaseModule"><code>BaseModule</code></a>,
      which provides (among other things) a basic
      <code>__init__</code> which does this and a few other things for
      you.  So you could also do:
    </p>

<pre class="python">
# in a file called FOO.py
import kibot.BaseModule
class FOO(kibot.BaseModule.BaseModule):
    pass
</pre>

	<p>
	  Once you have your module written, place it in the bot's module
	  path (the module path and other configuration values are dumped
	  to the log on startup).  The standard place to put your own
	  modules is in the <code>modules</code> subdirectory of the base
	  directory.  Once you've placed the module in the module path,
	  you can ask the bot to load your new module.  You do this by
	  typing <q>botnick: load FOO</q> on a public channel or just
	  <q>load FOO</q> via a private <code>/msg</code>.  Be sure to
	  watch the log.  If there are any problems, the python tracebacks
	  will be written there.
	</p>

	<a name="commands"></a>
	<h2>Defining commands</h2>

    <p>
      So, you want your module to have some commands, eh?  A command
      is simply an instance method.  These methods must take one
      argument, an instance of <a
      href="kibot/kibot.CommandHandler.html#Command"><code>Command</code></a>
      Let's make your first command.
    </p>

<pre class="python">
class FOO(kibot.BaseModule.BaseModule):
    _hello_cperm = 1 # we'll discuss this shortly
    def hello(self, cmd):
        cmd.reply('hello')
</pre>

    <p>
      This command will be called when anyone says hello to the bot,
      either by typing <code>botnick: hello</code> in a channel or
      msg-ing <code>hello</code> privately.  The command simply
      responds by saying <code>hello</code> back to them via the same
      mechanism.  If you prefer different reply behavior, there are <a
      href="kibot/kibot.CommandHandler.html#IRCReply">other methods</a>
      available.  There are a few other attributes of the <a
      href="kibot/kibot.CommandHandler.html#Command"><code>Command</code></a>
      object that you may find useful:
    </p>

<pre class="python">
class FOO(kibot.BaseModule.BaseModule):
    _hello_cperm = 1 # we'll discuss this shortly
    def hello(self, cmd):
        if cmd.channel: # will be None if command was /msg'ed
            cmd.reply('hello %s and the denizens of %s' 
                % (cmd.nick, cmd.channel))
        else:
            cmd.reply('hello %s' % cmd.nick)
</pre>

    <p>
      There is also <code>cmd.cmd</code>, which is the command as
      typed, which could be <code>hello</code> or
      <code>FOO.hello</code> or almost anything else if an alias is
      defined.  There is also <code>cmd.args</code>, which is the full
      string that was typed after the command.  There is a convenience
      method <code>.asplit()</code>, which returns a split (on
      whitespace) list of the arguments.
    </p>
    
<pre class="python">
a = cmd.asplit()
  # is equivalent to
a = string.split(cmd.args)
</pre>

    <p>
      There's also <code>cmd.shsplit()</code>, which does shell-style
      splitting that respects quotes and backslashes.  Each of these
      respects the <code>maxsplit</code> keyword.
    </p>

    <p>
      Methods of your class that begin with an underscore are
      considered private, and will not be listed in the help or be
      callable even if you provide a <code>_cperm</code> attribute.
      The one "exception" is <code>__call__</code>. See the google
      module for an example of how to use <code>__call__</code>.  The
      one problem with <code>__call__</code> is that the documentation
      doesn't work as nicely.
    </p>

	<a name="permissions"></a>
    <h2>Permissions</h2>

    <p>
      As you may have guessed, the <code>_hello_cperm</code> attribute
      defines the command permission for this command.  If it is the
      integer 1, than anyone can execute the command.  If it is 0,
      None or not present, the command is completely forbidden.  If it
      is a string, the corresponding user perm will be required.  It's
      actually quite powerful, but I won't get into the details here.
      There's another document that addresses it extensively.
    </p>

	<a name="documentation"></a>
    <h2>Documentation</h2>

    <p>
      The bot grabs the documentation from the doc strings of both the
      class and methods.  In each case the first line will be used as
      the <q>short</q> version of the documentation, and further lines
      will be printed only when you ask for help on that specific
      object.  Example:
    </p>

<pre class="python">
class FOO(kibot.BaseModule.BaseModule):
    """a silly little example
    This module doesn't do much but say hello"""

    _hello_cperm = 1 # we'll discuss this shortly
    def hello(self, cmd):
        """respond with 'hello'
        hello
        this command is really pretty dumb :)"""
        cmd.reply('hello')
</pre>
	
	<p>
	  The second line of function help is normally usage (not so obvious in
	  this case).
	</p>
	
	<a name="logging"></a>
	<h2>Logging</h2>

	<p>
	  Kibot supports centrallized logging for the benefit of both the
	  module author and the bot owner.  The bot owner can have
	  multiple log destinations (usually files) each with its own log
	  threshold.  The log threshold determines how much stuff gets
	  written to it.  A low log threshold means that only very
	  important information gets written, whereas a high threshold
	  means that tons of information can be written.
	</p>

	<p>
	  As a module auther, you must decide what to log, and at what log
	  <i>level</i> to log it.  A higher log level corresponds to a less
	  important log.  In case you hadn't guessed, a log message's level gets
	  compared to a log destination's threshold to determine whether or not
	  it should be written there.
	</p>

    <p>
	  Here is a command that does nothing but record what is passed in to
	  the log file with a level of 2.  Please use some sort of prefix for all
	  logs.  A reasonable convention is to begin all log messages with the
	  module name in caps.  Remember that all modules and core bot functions
	  will be logging to the same place, so a log such as <q>bad argument</q>
	  will not be very useful unless you provide some context.
	</p>

<pre class="python">
class FOO(kibot.BaseModule.BaseModule):
    _log_cperm = 1
    def log(self, cmd):
        """write a message to the log files
        log &lt;message&gt;"""
        self.bot.log(2, 'FOO.log: %s' % (cmd.args, ))
</pre>

	<p>
	  Here are some rough guidelines about what level you should use for
	  log messages.  Examples of when the bot itself uses these levels
	  are provided.
	</p>

	<table cellspacing="0">
	  <tr>
		<th>Level</th><th>Description</th>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<td class="center">0</td>
		<td>very important message, fatal error, something is broken</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<td class="center">1</td>
		<td>major events (modules loaded/unloaded)</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<td class="center">2</td>
		<td>important but normal events (handlers and timers are set/unset)</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<td class="center">3</td>
		<td>the day-to-day stuff (commands, op-ing and inviting users)</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<td class="center">5</td>
		<td>most of the instructions the bot is given (events, timers)</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<td class="center">7</td>
		<td>handy information for writing modules (raw traffic to/from the server)</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<td class="center">9</td>
		<td>stuff that's useful only when something is wrong (entry/exit of all commands)</td>
	  </tr>
	</table>
	
	<a name="server"></a>
    <h2>Communicating directly with the server</h2>

    <p>
      If you want to do more complex interactions, you can use
      attributes of the bot object.  For example, lets build a
      <code>kick</code> command.
    </p>

<pre class="python">
class FOO(kibot.BaseModule.BaseModule):
    _kick_cperm = 1 # probably not a good idea
    def kick(self, cmd):
        """kick one or more users
        kick [nicks]"""
        for nick in cmd.asplit():
            # bot.conn is the ServerConnection object
            bot.conn.kick(nick)
</pre>

    <p>
      Most standard irc commands are implemented in the connection
      object.  If we want to do some simple checking first, we can
      consult the bot's irc database, where it keeps track of users:
    </p>

<pre class="python">
class FOO(kibot.BaseModule.BaseModule):
    _kick_cperm = 1 # probably not a good idea
    def kick(self, cmd):
        """kick one or more users
        kick [nicks]"""
        if not cmd.channel:
            cmd.reply('ask me on a channel')
            return
        
        chan_obj = cmd.bot.ircdb.channels[cmd.channel]
    
        if not chan_obj.is_oper(cmd.bot.nick):
            cmd.reply("I don't have ops on %s" % cmd.channel)
            return

        for nick in cmd.asplit():
            if chan_obj.has_user(nick):
                bot.conn.kick(nick)
            else:
                reply("there's no %s on %s" % (nick, cmd.channel))
</pre>

    <p>
      You might be tempted to keep some of these handy objects around
      by saving them as <code>self.chan_obj</code> or something.
      <b>Do not do that!</b> The only safe object is the bot object
      itself.  The reason is that almost any object can be reloaded
      dynamically.  For example, the ircdb object might be reloaded,
      and if your module has stored a reference locally, you'll have
      the <b>old</b> version.  Always access them via
      <code>self.bot</code> object.  You can make convenience
      references for use within a single function call (as we did
      above) but don't keep them around.
    </p>

	<a name="loading"></a>
    <h2>Loading and unloading properly</h2>

    <p>
      You need to think about loading and unloading if you have
      handlers, timers or stored data.  It's pretty easy.  Loading is
      done in <code>__init__</code> (duh), and when your module is
      un-loaded, the method <code>_unload(self)</code> will be called
      (if it's defined).
    </p>

	<a name="handlers"></a>
    <h2>Setting handlers</h2>

    <p>
      Handlers are functions that will be called upon irc "events",
      which are typically lines received from the server.  Handlers
      take two arguments: the connection object (which will usually be
      the same as <code>bot.conn</code>) and an <a
      href="kibot/kibot.m_irclib.html#Event"><code>Event</code></a> object.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lets say you want to welcome anyone who joins a channel.  You might
      write the following handler:
    </p>

<pre class="python">
from kibot.irclib import nm_to_n
class FOO(kibot.BaseModule.BaseModule):
    def _on_join(self, c, e):
        channel = e.target
        nick = nm_to_n(e.source)
        c.privmsg(channel, 'welcome to %s, %s' % (channel, nick))
</pre>

    <p>
      You need to set the handler so that it gets called on "join"s.  You do
      this by calling:
    </p>

<pre class="python">
self.bot.set_handler('join', self._on_join, 5)
</pre>

    <p>
      This sets <code>_on_join</code> to be called when 'join' events
      occur.  This handler is given priority 5.  Lower values mean
      handlers will be called sooner (if there are multiple handlers
      for a given event).  You should not use a value lower than 0.
      Negative values are for internal bot handlers, like keeping the
      irc database updated.  This rule is not enforced, but you can
      screw stuff up or (more likely) confuse yourself.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a handler returns the string <q><code>NO MORE</q></code> or
      raises the exception <code>StopHandlingEvent</code> (defined in
      <a
      href="kibot/kibot.m_irclib.html"><code>kibot.m_irclib</code></a>)
      then no more handlers will be called for that event.  Make sure
      you know what you're doing if you do this.  Normal commands
      (like the ones we wrote above) are called from an internal
      priority 20 handler, so it is possible to take action before a
      command is received.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can delete a handler with the command
    </p>

<pre class="python">
self.bot.del_handler('join', self._on_join, 5)
</pre>
    
    <p>
      The priority is ignored, but accepted.  For convenience, the <a
      href="kibot/kibot.BaseModule.html#BaseModule"><code>BaseModule</code></a>
      class provides the functions:
    </p>

<pre class="python">
def _set_handlers(self, priority=0, prefix="_on_"): ...
def _del_handlers(self, priority=0, prefix="_on_"): ...
</pre>

    <p>
      If you call these, they will set or remove handlers for all
      functions with the prefix <q><code>_on_</code></q>.  You can
      alternatively, provide a list of handlers by setting the class
      attribute <code>_handlers</code>.  For example:
    </p>
    
<pre class="python">
_handlers = ['join']
</pre>

    <p>
      Be sure to delete any set handlers in <code>_unload</code>.
    </p>


	<p>
	  Few events are well documented.  This is mildly annoying, but frankly,
	  there's an easier way to learn about events than reading about them.
	  The best way to program handlers is to run a bot at a high log level
	  (between 5 and 10) and generate the event.  For example, if you want
	  to see how to deal with a DCC request, run your bot at log level 10
	  and send a DCC CHAT request.  You should see this roll in:
	</p>

<div class="fakepre">
FROM SERVER: :nick!~username@host.domain.com PRIVMSG botnick :DCC CHAT chat 3287712632 35715<br />
EVENT: type: ctcp_dcc, source: nick!~username@host.domain.com, target: botnick, args: ['CHAT chat 3287712632 35715']<br />
EVENT: type: ctcp, source: nick!~username@host.domain.com, target: botnick, args: ['DCC', 'CHAT chat 3287712632 35715']<br />
</div>

	<p>
	  In this case, two events are generated: one generic
	  <code>ctcp</code> event, and one specific <code>ctcp_dcc</code>
	  event.  You can choose which you want to deal with depending on
	  your task.  The advantage of this approach is that you can see
	  exactly what the event looks like.  There is one attribute of
	  the <a
	  href="kibot/kibot.m_irclib.html#Event"><code>Event</code></a>
	  class that is not printed in the logs.  There is a
	  <code>raw</code> object which (in most cases) contains the raw
	  line that generated the event.  That line is shown in the logs
	  above on the <code>FROM SERVER:</code> line.  Some special
	  bot-generated events, such as <code>command_not_found</code>,
	  <code>permission_denied</code> and a few others include some
	  other data structure in the <code>raw</code> attribute.
	</p>

	<a name="timers"></a>
	<h2>Setting timers</h2>

    <p>
      Timers can be used to perform delayed or repeated actions.
      Timers are by creating instances of the <a
      href="kibot/kibot.m_irclib.html#Timer"><code>Timer</code></a>
      class.
    </p>

<pre class="python">
self.timer = Timer(seconds, func, args=(), kwargs={}, fromnow=1, repeat=None)
</pre>

    <p>
      and registered with 
    </p>

<pre class="python">
self.bot.set_timer(self.timer)
</pre>

    <p>
      The function <code>func</code> will be called after
      <code>seconds</code> seconds.  If <code>fromnow == 0</code>,
      then <code>seconds</code> will be interpreted as a unix time.
      The function will be passed args and <code>kwargs</code>.  If
      <code>repeat</code> is a number, <code>func</code> will be
      repeated at that interval (in seconds).
    </p>

    <p>
      Repeating timers should return 0 or 1.  A return of 1 means that
      the timer should continue to repeat.  If it returns 0, it will
      be terminated.  Timers that are not repeated (or returned 0) do
      not need to be removed, but they can be.  Repeating timers
      should be removed on <code>_unload</code> just like handlers.
      Timers can be removed by calling
    </p>

<pre class="python">
self.bot.del_timer(self.timer)
</pre>

	<a name="stashers"></a>
	<h2>Storing data</h2>

    <p>
      Data can be stored easily by using stashers.  A <a
      href="kibot/kibot.Stasher.html"><code>Stasher</code></a> is a
      python object that acts like a <code>dict</code>, but
      transparently stores the data to disk.  You can interact with
      them directly, but the easiest thing to do is to use some of the
      convenience methods and attributes defined in <a
      href="kibot/kibot.BaseModule.html#BaseModule"><code>kibot.BaseModule</code></a>.
      Here is an example that demonstrates the use of stashers for
      storing users' email addresses.
    </p>

<pre class="python">
import kibot.BaseModule
class addressbook(kibot.BaseModule.BaseModule):
    _stash_format = 'repr'     # format for the file
    _stash_attrs = ['email']   # which attributes to load/save
    def __init__(self, bot):
        self.bot = bot
        self.email = {}
        # if the attribute wasn't in the file, or the file didn't exist,
        # then it won't do anthing.  Otherwise it will overwrite the
        # default we just set.
        self._unstash() # load attributes listed in _stash_attrs

    def _unload(self):
        self._stash()   # forces a save

    _setemail_cperm = 1
    def setemail(self, cmd):
        nick, email = cmd.asplit(1)
        self.email[nick] = email
        # self._stash() # you may want to force a save here, too

    _getemail_cperm = 1
    def getemail(self, cmd):
        try:
            email = self.email[cmd.args]
        except KeyError, e:
            cmd.reply("I don't have an email address for %s" % cmd.args)
        else:
            cmd.reply(email)
</pre>

	<p>
	  There are a number of noteworthy things going on here.  First,
	  data will be stored in a file named
	  <code>addressbook.repr</code> in the bot's data directory.  The
	  name is automatically grabbed from the module name and format.
	  There are three formats available: <code>repr</code>,
	  <code>pickle</code>, and <code>shelve</code>.  They are named
	  after their respective python tools.  Each has its own
	  advantages and disadvantages.
	</p>

	<dl>
	  <dt><code>repr</code></dt>
	  <dd>
		The <code>repr</code> format uses a text representation of the
		data, which makes it very easy to view and edit by hand.  It
		is relatively large and slow becuase all data must be
		rewritten for each change.  It is also somewhat restrictive
		about what types of data may be included.  Class instances may
		not be storable, although an arbitrary nesting of
		<code>dict</code>s, <code>list</code>s, strings, etc. are
		fine.  This is recommended for small, simple data sets that you
		may want to view/edit by hand.
	  </dd>

	  <dt><code>pickle</code></dt>
	  <dd>
		This format <code>pickle</code>s the entire structure and
		writes it on each save.  It is the smallest format, and most
		flexible about data types.  This is recommended for small complex
		data types.
	  </dd>

	  <dt><code>shelve</code></dt>
	  <dd>
		This format uses a db to store the key/value pairs from the 
		<code>dict</code>.  The values are <code>pickle</code>d first.
		This can be bulky for small data sets, but can be efficient for
		larger or more frequently accessed data sets because it need not
		rewrite the whole data set for a single modification.  This
		is recommended for large data sets.
	  </dd>
	</dl>

	<p>
	  Note that each attribute in <code>_stash_attrs</code> will be
	  one key in the <a
	  href="kibot/kibot.Stasher.html"><code>Stasher</code></a> object.
	  Therefore, if your email list grows to thousands of people, you
	  do not really gain the benefit that you'd like from
	  <code>shelve</code>.  To do that, you should get a <a
	  href="kibot/kibot.Stasher.html"><code>Stasher</code></a> object
	  directly, and make each nick/email pair its own key/value pair
	  in the <a
	  href="kibot/kibot.Stasher.html"><code>Stasher</code></a>.  This is
	  not discussed in this document, but an example can be found in
	  <a
	  href="kibot/kibot.ircDB.html#ircDB"><code>kibot.ircDB.ircDB</code></a>
	  for the <code>self.known</code> attribute.

	<h2>Managing module settings</h2>

	<p>
	  You may need to be able to dynamically set module
	  <q>settings</q>.  A setting is simply an attribute of the module
	  that can be read and written via the commands <code>base.get</code>
	  and <code>base.set</code>.  Here's an example:
	</p>

<pre class="python">
import kibot.BaseModule
from kibot.Settings import Setting
class arithmetic(kibot.BaseModule.BaseModule):
    _settings = [
        Setting('base', 10, 'the base in which to return answers')
        ]

    _add_cperm = 1
    def add(self, cmd):
        nums = cmd.asplit()
        sum = 0
        for i in nums:
            try: sum += int(i)
            except: pass
        cmd.reply(self._stringify(sum))

    def _stringify(self, num):
        nums = '0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
        base = int(self.base)
        st = ''
        num = int(num)
        while sum != 0:
            num, rmd = num / base, num % base
            st = nums[rmd] + st
        return st
</pre>

	<p>
	  You can now give commands to the bot to <code>set</code> and
	  <code>get</code> the current base.  These commands must be given
	  with the full path, as in <q><code>set arithmetic.base
	  16</code></q>.
    </p>

    <p>
	  As used above, the attribute <code>self.base</code> will always
	  be set to a string.  If you want to do something more complex,
	  you can provide other arguments to the constructor
	  <code>Setting</code>.  See the <code>Settings</code> <a
	  href="kibot/kibot.Settings.html">documentation</a> for more
	  details.  In this case, you probably want the <code>conv_func</code>,
	  which is passed the raw string as typed by the user, and returns
	  the converted value.

<pre class="python">
class arithmetic(kibot.BaseModule.BaseModule):
    _settings = [
        Setting('base', 10, 'the base in which to return answers',
                conv_func=int)
        ]
</pre>
	</p>

	<p>
	  Settings are not automatically <q>stashed</q>, but they are treated
	  like any other attributes.  Simply include the setting name in
	  <code>_stash_attrs</code> to have them stashed.
	</p>

	<p>
	  In the examples above, we have not overridden <code><a
	  href="kibot/kibot.BaseModule.html">BaseModule</a></code>'s
	  <code>__init__</code>.  If you do, you should probably do
<pre class="python">
    self._settings = init_settings(self, self._settings)
</pre>
	  within your <code>__init__</code>.  This is where the default
	  values get set.
	</p>

	<h2>Kibot structure</h2>

	<p>
	  If you need to do more complex things, you may need to know a
	  little more about the structure of the bot and some of its
	  common objects.  Here is a heirarchical view of objects you're
	  likely to need and their public attributes.
	  
	  <ul>
		<li>bot - instance of <a href="kibot/kibot.Bot.html#Bot">
			kibot.Bot.Bot</a></li>
		  <ul>
			<li>ircdb - instance of <a href="kibot/kibot.ircDB.html#ircDB">
				kibot.ircDB.ircDB</a></li>
			<li>permdb - instance of <a href="kibot/kibot.permDB.html#permDB">
				kibot.permDB.permDB</a></li>
			<li>mod - instance of <a href="kibot/kibot.ModuleManager.html#ModuleManager">
				kibot.ModuleManager.ModuleManager</a></li>
			<li>conn - instance of <a href="kibot/kibot.m_irclib.html#ServerConnection">
				kibot.m_irclib.ServerConnection</a></li>
		  </ul>
		</li>
		
		<li>cmd - instance of <a href="kibot/kibot.CommandHandler.html#Command">
			kibot.CommandHandler.Command</a> passed to command functions</li>

		<li>event - instance of <a href="kibot/kibot.m_irclib.html#Event">
			kibot.m_irclib.Event</a> passed to handlers</li>
	  </ul>
